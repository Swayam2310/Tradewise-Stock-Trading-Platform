2023-12-22,"AI, EVs, Fed, consumers, election: Investor Guide highlights","As 2023 comes to a close, investors want to know what’s in store for the year ahead. What's in store from the Fed in 2024? Will the AI hype continue? What is the future of EV charging? How will the 2024 election impact the market? Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to answer these questions and more as part of the weekly series ""Investor Guide 2024."" Market outlook (00:00:05) Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield anticipates the S&P to reach as high as 5,500 points by the end of 2024. Hatfield said, ""Europe is in a recession. And so we think the ECB is going to be forced to cut first, which will give the U.S. Federal Reserve cover. So it's really more of a global focus."" Goldman Sachs Chief US Economist David Mericle predicts that recession odds have eased to 15%, but challenges still loom over the U.S. economy. ""The soft landing has gone from on track to largely here,"" Mericle explained. ""Rather than gliding into the mid-2s next year, which would have been a perfectly good outcome, it now looks like instead we are abruptly finding ourselves more or less at a 2% underlying pace."" AI (00:00:47) Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) helped to drive the AI hype in 2023. But did the AI frenzy steal all of the metaverse's thunder? Wagner James Au, Author of Making a Metaverse That Matters, joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on the metaverse’s outlook for 2024 and whether a comeback is possible. He said, ""The metaverse ... has actually been growing in terms of monthly active users, upwards of 600 million active users, led by Roblox (RBLX) is the leading metaverse platform."" Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Global Chair Richard Lesser discussed the use cases for AI that companies will seek to implement in the coming year. ""I think companies are going to end up spending a lot more on AI in the year ahead,"" Lesser explained. ""Companies are going to realize there's a lot of value to be created here."" Ruben Roy, Stifel Applied Technology Analyst, broke down the semiconductor market outlook and the possibilities for semiconductor companies in 2024. ""We think Nvidia is one of the first semiconductor companies that's cracked the code on becoming a software and services company,"" Roy said. ""I think that's where investors should be looking. I think that's going to be the big theme when you look ahead to 2024."" Oil, energy, and gas (00:01:36) 2023 was a volatile year for oil prices (BZ=F, CL=F). Rebecca Babin, CIBC Private Wealth, U.S. Senior Energy Trader discussed some of the major catalysts for oil in 2024. Babin said, ""So I think the key for 2024 is going to be what does U.S. supply do? Looking at 2024, the market looks very well balanced ... the key that people are looking at is can the U.S. continue to outperform."" Tesla (TSLA) has had quite a turbulent year in 2023. iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer discussed the outlook for Tesla in 2024 amid the competition from major companies like Ford (F) and GM (GM). Brauer said, ""Tesla shares ... they're down to about half the market. And of course they were the overwhelmingly dominant player just a few years ago. Every day, every month, every year we see more cars entering this marketplace, making them less dominant."" Looking ahead to 2024, Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy, discussed how geopolitical tensions and other factors may impact oil and gas prices. De Haan explained, ""The national average is basically on par with where we were last year, but we could see a little bit more increase over the next few days into the holiday and into the close of the New Year."" State of the consumer (00:02:36) Investors often look for recession proof investments during uncertain times, including food and beverage staples. Peter Saleh, BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, top picks for 2024 include McDonald's (MCD) and Domino's (DPZ). ""2024 we're going to start the year with a lot of discounts. We're already seeing that, and in that type of environment McDonald's tends to take some share,"" Saleh said. ""One of our top picks for 2024 is Domino's."" The Magnificent Seven didn't just dominate the markets this year, they also topped the list of the most trafficked ticker pages on Yahoo Finance. Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) topped the ranking. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre broke down the list. ""Not surprisingly in a year that was all about the mega caps, the Mag Seven, they dominate the top ten most popular pages visited by you on the Yahoo Finance app and website,"" Blikre said. ""And the winner by far is Tesla ... that was seen over 300 million times this year."" 2024 election (00:03:21) The 2024 election cycle is right around the corner and with that comes massive swaths of information about the candidates and the election itself. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley broke down the impact that generative AI can have on the election, specifically as it pertains to disinformation. Howley said, ""The AI revolution has really supercharged a lot of companies ... but there also are some drawbacks, and those include the spread of disinformation and misinformation ... basically allowing them to manipulate the news."" LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder discussed the historical impact of the presidential election on the stock market. Buchbinder explained, ""If you look back at history, the economy is really the biggest driver of not just how elections turn out but how markets do. So if we continue to have surprises on the U.S. economy like we've had in 2023, then no doubt this market can do quite a bit better than that historical average.""

2023-12-18,"China Apple ban, Nike earnings, holiday market: What to watch","China’s ban on Apple Phones (AAPL) continues to spread. Nike (NKE) reports fiscal 2024 first quarter results this week. The stock market has seen quite the rally toward the end of 2023, with inflation cooling and the Federal Reserve signaling rate cuts next year. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to discuss these trending stories and more. Here is what investors are watching this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer discussed the earnings on deck this week, highlighted by Nike. Schafer said, ""We're going to get Nike's report through the end of November, so we're going to get part of those holiday sales. We're going to understand how Nike started the holiday season, and then also get their outlook for what they expect."" Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre broke down the stock market rally and what to expect heading into 2024. Blikre said, ""We are in the midst of a nice rally ... if we do have historical norms, we should get additional rallies into the end of the year. There have been arguments that some of that has been brought forward already all the way back to Thanksgiving. But we see the incredible bullishness in the markets just continue."" Yahoo Finance’s Ines Ferré discussed China's ongoing ban on Apple iPhones and the market impact for Apple. Ferré said, ""This is a big step up in the directive from China telling its state agencies that their employees should leave their foreign devices at home ... this is a direct blow to Apple's market share in China."" NewEdge Wealth Senior Portfolio Manager Ben Emons discussed 2024 investment opportunities amid potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Emons said, ""I think what Powell did last week was somewhat historic in a way ... if the dollar sets in motion a broader weakening trend, not only are the boats in commodities lifted, so will they be in emerging markets."" Yahoo Finance’s Ines Ferré broke down the current U.S. gas prices and what to expect from the gas and oil markets in 2024. Ferré said, ""For the last 13 weeks, we have seen a downward trend in gasoline prices ... I've spoken to several analysts, and they are predicting that yes, by the end of the year if these trends continue you are likely to see sub $3 per gallon across the U.S. Definitely this bodes well with the fight against inflation.""

The price tag for the device comes in at $3,499, or $291.58 per month over 12 months. With such a high price tag and several augmented/virtual reality competitors already on the market, is the device even worth it for consumers? The Verge Senior Wearables Reviewer Victoria Song joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Apple's AR-VR device and what it could mean for the company going forward.

Any time... people like myself have looked at a new Apple category when it launches, there's a tendency to go, 'Oh, who's going to use that?'""

2024-02-15,Beyond the Ticker: Nvidia,"From creating chips for gaming to becoming one of the world's leading AI chip companies, it's safe to say Nvidia (NVDA) is officially one of the tech giants. In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry.

NetChoice Vice President and General Counsel Carl Szabo joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes the Department of Justice faces an ""uphill climb"" in this legal battle. According to Szabo, the monopoly accusations ""just doesn't make sense."" He points out that when Americans buy a smartphone, they have ""two clear choices"": Apple and Android devices, disbarring any assumptions of a monopoly. He notes as this legal battle continues, Apple's innovation efforts may be impacted ""out of fear"" of being accused of monopolistic practices. Szabo notes that as long as Apple can provide evidence that supports ""business purposes for what they are doing,"" the courts will most likely rule in their favor. He suggests that many of the concerns raised by the DOJ can be ""easily dismissed"" due to the legitimate purposes they serve in relation to Apple products like security prevention and payment processing.

Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi by the Cannes waterfront to talk about where linear TV and sports streaming fits into the broadening streaming landscape, as more platforms like Amazon Prime (AMZN) adopt ad-supported subscription tiers. ""One of the reasons paid TV is in such [a] secular and substantial decline is the cost of those sports rights. And everyone had to bear the cost of those sports rights. So you had every consumer, almost every household had paid TV 10 years ago, and everyone was paying not only for the entertainment that they loved, but also for sports,"" Mayer explains. ""And not everyone watched the sports. And I think that helped drive the decline down. People were paying for something in a very expensive thing that they didn't really want to watch.  ""So I think Netflix (NFLX) will put their toe in the water, but they've become a very successful entertainment company without sports. They have sports-related programming, but not the actual sports rights."" Mayer finds that these major streaming companies need to incorporate these new sports partnerships in order to ""feed their ecosystem in some way."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. Mayer comments on the potential ban of TikTok within the United States and the acquisition sage surrounding Paramount Global (PARA, PARAA).

Nintendo exec talks game industry 'poised for an upswing',"The video game industry is reaching outside of its comfort zone as audiences are seeing exposure to more video game adaptations, TV series, M&A activity between studios, and even partnerships with popular streaming services. ""The overall entertainment industry is large, it's a significant part of the global economy. And gaming is the biggest part of that — it's a $200 billion business today. It's bigger than streaming, bigger than the movie box office. Across the globe, 3 billion people play video games,"" former Nintendo (NTDOY) of America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé explains to Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend. An industry veteran, Fils-Aimé held the positions of Nintendo of America president and COO from 2006 to 2019. He believes the gaming industry is ""poised for an upswing"" following post-pandemic contractions from game studios and consumers. Fils-Aimé weighs in on rising trends in gaming, including VR and AR headsets (virtual reality and augmented reality) — namely Apple's (AAPL) costly Vision Pro — and cloud gaming technology. Cloud gaming is ""just going to be another way that consumers can get access to games in the end, this is an industry that is driven by content,"" Fils-Aimé says, underlining the fact that it will ""always come down to the games"" no matter the platform or hardware behind it.

""We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict,"" Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that ""no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves."" Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, ""in the long term it's going to do well."" In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure ""and be exposed to it in a very diversified way.""

Seana Smith and Brad Smith help investors through the market open and discuss what's moving markets, like June's retail sales data. In this installment of The Morning Brief, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) reported second quarter earnings. Argus Research director of financial services research Stephen Biggar joins the show to discuss the latest Big Bank earnings and what lower interest rates would hold in store for the banking sector. As Apple (AAPL) hopes to inspire a new upgrade cycle in its newest iPhone's AI features — dubbed Apple Intelligence — the tech giant also has its eyes set on the consumer market in India. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria describes the country's consumer prospects as a ""long-term promise"" for Apple.

2024-07-16,Amazon may not be getting the AI credit it deserves: Analyst,"D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss some of the biggest trends dominating the tech sector as second quarter earnings season kicks off. Luria points to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI efforts driving a PC upgrade cycle. He explains, ""the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth."" He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have ""grown earnings when others have not."" He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, ""they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified."" He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, ""AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform.""

Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss the tech giant's growth and what it means for its upcoming iPhone release cycle. AI integration will be a key component in the newest iPhones as Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI at its Worldwide Developers Conference. ""We haven't had a major iPhone upgrade cycle since iPhone 12. And now that there is a sense that there's enough new functionality and uses for the phone that we will have an upgrade cycle, which could last for a year or two. That warrants this excitement around the stock,"" Luria says. He believes that new Apple Intelligence features will compel consumers enough to drive a new device upgrade cycle. As Apple looks to diversify its exposure to global consumer markets, Luria believes India ""has a long-term promise,"" explaining: ""It's the country that's creating the most middle-class and upper-middle-class population anywhere around the world by far. It is in that sense the kind of driver that China was for the last 20 or 30 years. And so that's why it's a critically important market.""

Zino notes that while tech has ""led the way"" in the market recovery, it remains ""the worst performing sector"" since July's market peak. Semiconductors experienced the most severe sell-off but have since shown the strongest gains and recovery. Looking ahead, Zino predicts ""more choppy action"" following this surge, expecting market volatility to persist for the next 2-3 months and through the election period. He notes that earnings drive tech stocks and highlights two potential catalysts: Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell launch and the likely Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 release. ""Those are the two product launches that we think could potentially see more upside to consensus estimates,"" Zino states. However, he cautions investors not to ""expect anything too extreme here, at least in the immediate near term"" from the tech sector.

If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

2024-08-28,Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple stake to have 'margin of safety',"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) trimmed its stake in Apple (AAPL) by over 50% at the beginning of August. Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what the firm may do with the cash. Lynch explains that consumers and investors shouldn't be concerned about the move. Rather, he sees it as a testament to Buffett's commitment to having a margin of safety: ""Look, it's a great company, but he bought it in 2016 at 10 times earnings. He's cut it over half when it's been trading above 30 times earnings. It hasn't moved its sales and its operating income level on the aggregate in almost three years, so he's worried about the margin of safety there."" He adds that with this new cash flow, Buffett is ""finding places to play,"" but ultimately is ""waiting for better valuation."" Lynch notes that Berkshire recently bought Chubb (CB), an insurance company, explaining that insurance premiums are increasing about 10% yearly. In addition, Buffett has identified several lucrative opportunities in Japan. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

But it's a great time for a sale if you don't care about having the newest stuff because retailers have to sell their inventory, so they're going to discount all the current earbuds and the other gear like old phones.""
